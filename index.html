          <div class="post-contect">
            <p>Growing up in place were nobody knows how to make a <strong>website</strong>, or even to code can be tough for a teenager with a passion for coding. That is why it has not been easy for me to go after my dreams since nobody around me seem not to be interested in programing.</p>
            <p>I myself also never knew that they was something such as programming that existed in the world. I came across coding by mistake while browsing youtube back when I was twleve, I saw a video which my teaching people on how to make a website using python. That is when I grew interested in programming</p>
            <p>In no time at all I tought myself how to code using python which was not that difficult, then went on to learn Java, Then HTML,CSS,Javascript. learning all these languages was not easy since I did not have a computer to practice on so i could forget them pretty often and had to learn them again.</p>
            <P>When I finnaly got my own laptop to practice on when I had just turn 15 I immediately downloaded VS code IDE and Android Studio to make simple apps and websites like this one you are reading this <em>article</em> from.</p>
